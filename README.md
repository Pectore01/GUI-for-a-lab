# Workstation expension

This project is made to test out the capabilties of certain devices which can be found on a lab table. 
The aim is to make it user friendly and ready for use with basic functionalities.
Unlike most setups which use serial communication this projected opted for ethernet due to the higher speeds and easier connection setup due to LIX.
