# Workstation expension

This is an internship project done for WeFabricate.
It's regarding a workstation which will be used to diagnose and repair PCBA's.
This will be done by adding multiple devices so that the service engineer can fully test the PCBA without any safety concerns.
The current workstation can only use 230VAC and do the normal test procedures that are also done during production.
